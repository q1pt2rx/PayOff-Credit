# PayOff-Credit
simple command line program to figure out how long it takes to pay off credit debt

works best for credit card debt and rates
"works" for very rough mortgage debt calculation

Currently very easily broken with values it doesn't like;
will make more versatile in future with more bulletproof code.
i.e. must take only ints here and only doubles there
